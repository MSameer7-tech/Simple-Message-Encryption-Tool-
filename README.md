# Simple-Message-Encryption-Tool-
This repository contains a simple message encryption tool using python language. This is also a ready to go code which uses some built-in python modules. This tool takes an input ( we can write anything in input) and encrypts it (convets it into unreadable content). You can decrypt the encrypted content by executing the same code and select the decrypt option.
